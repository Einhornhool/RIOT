# Minimal Example Applications for PSA Crypto
This is a showcase for the use of the PSA Crypto for cryptographic operations.
It executes the following operations:
- Key import
- Key destruction
- Random number generation

## TBD
This example will be extended as more operations are supported by PSA.
