 * @defgroup pkg_cryptoauthlib Microchip CryptoAuthentication Library
 * @ingroup  pkg drivers
 * @brief    Provides the library for Microchip CryptoAuth devices
 * @see      https://github.com/MicrochipTech/cryptoauthlib
 *
 * # Introduction
 *
 * This package provides support for the official library for Microchip CryptoAuth devices.
 *
 *
 * ## Warning
 *
 * Some functions can only be used, when the data, config and otp zones of the
 * device are locked. Locking is permanent and cannot be undone. Be careful if
 * you're not sure you've configured everything correctly.
 * For more information we refer to the data sheet of the device.
 *
 *
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Add
 * USEPKG += cryptoauthlib
 * to your Makefile.
 *
 *
 * ## Implementation status
 *
 * This implementation was partly tested with the ATECC508A. We haven't tested the
 * functions that require locking the device, yet. There's a wrapper in the
 * cryptoauthlib/contrib folder, which implements most of the HAL functions.
 * Currently the functions hal_i2c_discover_devices and hal_i2c_discover_buses
 * are unimplemented, as well as hal_i2c_post_init.
 *
 *
 * ## Tests
 *
 * The library provides unittests for the library functions. There
 * is a directory called "pkg_cryptoauthlib_internal_tests" in the RIOT testfolder
 * which runs part of the unittests.
 * Some of the provided tests can only be run when the config, data and/or otp zones
 * of the device are locked. Some tests (but not all) will automatically lock zones
 * as needed. Zones can only be locked permanently. Unlocking is not possible!
 * Also there is a test for comparing the runtime of the RIOT software implementation
 * and the CryptoAuth hardware implementation for calculating a SHA-256 hash value.
