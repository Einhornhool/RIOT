 * @ingroup  pkg sys_psa_crypto
 * @brief    Provides the ARM PSA Architecture Testsuite
 * @see      https://github.com/ARM-software/psa-arch-tests
 *
 * # Introduction
 * This package provides the ARM PSA Architecture Testsuite. It is being used
 * by tests/psa_crypto.
 *
 * It contains tests for all PSA developer APIs and the ARM Firmware Framework.
 *
 * ## Usage
 * Add
 * CONFIG_PACKAGE_PSA_ARCH_TESTS=y
 * to your application's app.config file.
 * You will also need to provide a file called testsuite.db which contains the
 * names of the test cases you want to build.
 * The compiled testsuite provides three archives, which need to be included in
 * the application's makefile:
 * ARCHIVES += $(BINDIR)/pkg-build/psa_arch_tests/dev_apis/crypto/test_combine.a
 * ARCHIVES += $(BINDIR)/pkg-build/psa_arch_tests/val/val_nspe.a
 * ARCHIVES += $(BINDIR)/pkg-build/psa_arch_tests/platform/pal_nspe.a
 *
 * ## Implementation Status
 * The way this package is built and the utility functions are implemented, it
 * only can only be used to test the PSA Crypto API in a nonsecure execution
 * environment. It has not been tested for the other PSA developer APIs
 * and it does not yet support execution in secure processing environments.
